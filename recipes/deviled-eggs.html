    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These deviled eggs are delicious for Easter brunch and are always popular
      at our holiday parties. Adjust the amount of salt and sugar in this recipe
      to suit your taste. I like to add <em>onion</em> and <em>celery</em> for a
      little more texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect deviled eggs start with perfectly hard-cooked eggs. We recommend
      following our <strong>top-rated Hard-Boiled Eggs recipe</strong>, which
      takes about 50 minutes from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs:</strong> This recipe yields 12 deviled egg halves, so
        you'll need six boiled eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> Mayonnaise makes the filling extra creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> A teaspoon of white sugar lends a hint of
        sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vinegar:</strong> A teaspoon of white vinegar, meanwhile, cuts
        the sweetness with acidity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mustard:</strong> Use store-bought prepared mustard or homemade
        yellow mustard.

      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
